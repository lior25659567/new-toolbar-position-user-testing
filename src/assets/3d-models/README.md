# 3D Models Folder

Place your 3D dental model files here.

## Supported Formats

- **GLB / GLTF** (recommended) - Best for web, includes materials
- **OBJ** - Common 3D format (may need .mtl file for materials)
- **STL** - Common dental scan format
- **PLY** - Scan format with vertex colors

## How to Add Your Model

1. Drop your 3D file(s) into this folder
2. Let me know the filename
3. I'll integrate it into the app with interactive controls

## Example Files

After you add files, they might look like:
```
src/assets/3d-models/
├── lower-jaw.glb
├── upper-jaw.glb
├── full-scan.stl
└── README.md
```

## Notes

- GLB files are self-contained (single file)
- OBJ files may need accompanying .mtl and texture files
- STL files are geometry-only (I'll add default materials)
